{"name":"libgit2 bindings for Pharo","tagline":"","body":"#libgit2 bindings for Pharo\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is the development of [libgit2](http://libgit2.github.com) bindings for [Pharo](http://pharo-project.org).\r\n\r\n##prerequisites\r\n\r\nTo use these bindings you will need a Pharo 3 or 4 image and the latest VM:\r\n\r\n    curl get.pharo.org/40+vmLatest | bash\r\n    ./pharo-ui Pharo.image\r\n\r\n##installation\r\n\r\nEvaluate the following in a workspace:\r\n  \r\n    Gofer it\r\n      smalltalkhubUser: 'FileSystemGitDev' project: 'LibGit2';\r\n      configurationOf: 'LibGit';\r\n      loadBleedingEdge\r\n\r\n##github support\r\n\r\nThe current bindings include very crude patches to allow pull and push operations to / from remote repositories (e.g. github). For this to work you will need:\r\n  - a repository with [FileTree](https://github.com/dalehenrich/filetree) layout, where the FileTree packages are in the top level directory (the same the .git directory is in)\r\n  - the repository to use the branch 'master' (no other branches supported)\r\n  - the remote to have the name 'origin'\r\n\r\nTo use a remotely hosted repository:\r\n  1. add a new repository of type 'git://' to Monticello\r\n  2. enter the cloning url (e.g. git@github.com:theseion/LibGit)\r\n\r\nRepository access will now do a pull, commit will trigger a push.\r\n\r\n\r\n##disclaimer\r\n\r\nThis project is still very experimental and push / pull operations have been implemented for convenience only. I use them for daily development but be prepared for unexpected behavior and VM crashes.\r\nI will update the instructions in this document while I make progress.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
